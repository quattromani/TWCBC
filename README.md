Welcome to the Time Warner Cable Business Class Editorial Framework & Style Guide. This project is here to make your life easier; your code cleaner and more efficient.

## Style Guide / House Style
>A style guide is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents.

A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". When you see something marked "house style", you'll know that we're speaking specifically to a brand's style.

## Patterns

>A pattern describes an existing solution to a common problem within a specific context.

Each pattern has four primary components:  
1. a title  
2. a problem  
3. a context  
4. a solution  

You can see what's already a pattern at the [Component Library]. Don't be afraid to take an existing pattern and beat it into submission to create something new. Just be sure to name it and document it.
