<h3 id="header">The header Element</h3>

<p>The <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element is used to represent the introductory content to an article or web page. This will usually contain a heading element as well as some metadata that’s relevant to the content, such as the post date of a news article for example. It could also contain a table of contents (within a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element) for a longer document.</p>

<p>A <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element will be associated with the nearest sectioning element, usually it’s direct parent in the page structure.</p>
